# Awesome SWE Learning

[![Awesome Bot](https://github.com/followynne/awesome-swe-learning/actions/workflows/awesome.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/followynne/awesome-swe-learning/actions/workflows/awesome.yml)

Selected collection of (imho) high-quality learning resources on Software Development.

**Programming is easy... until you start to really program something. One day or another, you'll hit a wall - that's when you'll need to choose a good resource. How do you choose a good one, between the millions you can find on the net?**

The scope of this repo isn't to collect **every** existing learning resource - I'd like to have a restricted selection of trusted/known learning resources that a SWE could browse anytime he needs to explore & study a topic.

## Did I miss university?
###### on software-engineering basics

- :moneybag: [The Imposterâ€™s Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) by [Rob Conery](https://github.com/robconery)

  > How many topics seems to be "base knowledge" by everyone, then you stop for a second and notice... you don't have any idea on what the hell is {x}? A book to understand many crucial topics - you probably overlooked them to study a JS framework but, at the end of the road, they'll make you a wiser dev. 
  >
  > Btw, it's recommended by [Scott Hanselman](https://github.com/shanselman) == a must-have.
  >
  > (while you were reading those lines, the JS framework was archived)

- [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/) by [Jeremy Kun](https://jeremykun.com/)

  > Are you a math-illiterate, that never does anything more than multiplication? We're mates now. 
  >
  > This book will be useful when, in a lonely night in your life, stuck in a job that [doesn't give you the fulfillment you _know_ you have](http://antirez.com/news/129#futileness),  you'll think "today I'm learning maths to pass a FAANG interview and finally move to the North of EU, where the grass is greener etc etc"

## Oh gosh, 1 change request, 1k classes to update...
###### on design-patterns

## Why the hell should I double-write my code!?
###### _on testing_

- :moneybag: [Unit testing principles, practices, and patterns](https://www.manning.com/books/unit-testing) by [Vladimir Khorikov](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/)

  > Test. Trust me, test. IF you're reading me and you have doubts on testing it's boring I wanna do new feat-sssssh, trust me, TEST. 
  > 
  > You'll thank me later: the first time you'll only have a single test class, only doing a beautiful `ItStarts()`. When it will fail and it'll prevent you from deploying a lovely broken main, when you'll understand you've been on the verge of getting fired, I'll see you back here ;)
