# awesome-swe-learning
Selected collection of (imho) high-quality learning resources on Software Development.

**Programming is easy... until you start to really program something. One day or another, you'll hit a wall - that's when you'll need to choose a good resource. How do you choose a good one, between the millions you can find on the net?**

The scope of this repo isn't to collect **every** existing learning resource - I'd like to have a restricted selection of trusted/known learning resources that a SWE could browse anytime he needs to explore & study a topic.

Any suggestion contribution is welcomed :triumph:

## Did I miss university?

- [The Imposterâ€™s Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) by [Rob Conery](https://github.com/robconery)

  > How many topics seems to be "base knowledge" by everyone, then you stop for a second and notice... you don't have any idea on what the hell is {x}? A book to understand many crucial topics - you probably overlooked them to study a JS framework but, at the end of the road, they'll make you a wiser dev.

  > Btw, it's recommended by [Scott Hanselman](https://github.com/shanselman) == a must-have.

- [A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics](https://pimbook.org/) by [Jeremy Kun](https://jeremykun.com/)

  > Are you a math-illiterate, that never does anything more than multiplication? It means we're friends and this book will be useful for that lonely day in life you'll think "today I'm learning maths to pass a FAANG interview"
